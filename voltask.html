<h2> What is OPEN Source..??</h2>
<p>Open source software is software whose source code is available for modification or enhancement by anyone.
<b>Source code</b> is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see;
it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a program or application—works.
Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or 
fixing parts that don't always work correctly.</p>
<h2>
<h2> What is FREE Source..??</h2>
<P>
<b>Free software</b>means software that respects users' freedom and community.
 Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. 
 Thus, <b>free software </b>is a matter of liberty, not price.
 To understand the concept, you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer. 
 We sometimes call it libre software to show we do not mean it is gratis.
</P>
<h2>Relationship between the Free Software movement and Open Source movement</h2>
<p>The Free Software movement and the Open Source movement are like two political camps within the free software community.
Radical groups in the 1960s developed a reputation for factionalism: organizations split because of disagreements on details of strategy,and then treated each other as enemies.
Or at least, such is the image people have of them, whether or not it was true.The relationship between the Free Software movement and the Open Source movement is just the opposite of that picture. We disagree on the basic principles, but agree more or less on the practical recommendations. So we can and do work together on many specific projects. We don't think of the Open Source movement as an enemy. The enemy is proprietary software.
We are not against the Open Source movement, but we don't want to be lumped in with them. We acknowledge that they have contributed to our community, but we created this community, and we want people to know this. We want people to associate our achievements with our values and our philosophy, not with theirs. We want to be heard, not obscured behind a group with different views. To prevent people from thinking we are part of them, 
we take pains to avoid using the word open to describe free software, or its contrary,closed, in talking about non-free software.
So please mention the Free Software movement when you talk about the work we have done, and the software we have developed such as the GNU/Linux operating system.

<h2>Difference between Free software and Open source software</h2>
<p>Free software and open source software (collectively referred to as FOSS) are  two of the most popular concepts in the programming community.The free software movement has been around for some time now and open source has become a popular methodology in today’s world. Calling free software a movement and OSS a concept was deliberate; we will get to the motive behind the wordplay eventually while establishing a concrete understanding of the two words<BR>
To start decoding the ambiguity surrounding the two terms, we have to go back to how open source was <b>derived</b> from free software. Free software does not stand for software or codes that are free of cost, although most softwares produced under the free software license are free. This ambiguity was the primary reason for the establishment of OSS. But the OSS became a concept quite different from its parent by developing its own sets of values, philosophy and methodology.<br>
To make it easier lets go for a head on comparison. Free software movement was aimed at advocating the availability of free source codes and removal of copyrights. Also, whatever codes are derived from a free software license should also be released as free software. This posed a major problem in the commercialization of products. OSS which was initially introduced to remove the confusion caused by the <b>free</b>term took up the cause of removing the restrictions placed on commercialization. Codes under open source license can be used and modified, like free software, but the modified by-products do not have to be under the open source license. This helped in the commercialization of products produced using open source software. But since that was against what free software stood for, it separated the two into two different concepts. Thus free software was a movement that emphasized on the moral aspect of the availability of free codes and promoted intellectual freedom. But OSS was a practical solution to allow the business use of free codes. So, in a way, open source codes can be used for free software but the reverse causes a conflict.<br>
Except for these differences, both concepts are similar. Both allows you the freedom to view the source codes to read, copy and edit the codes and modify them to produce a different end products. Both advocates the availability of free source codes for all. But open source removes the restriction placed on the source code by a free software license. Commercialization is the motive behind it all.<br>
The question as to what to use and when depends entirely upon the creator. But, as we pointed out, open source softwares allow you to commercialize your products.<br>So open or free, both are a developer’s paradise giving them full freedom to view the source code and add/customize as desired.</p>
